# WAV3 - Together Create The Big Wave
## Origin ðŸŒŠ

Waves are caused by energy passing through the water, causing the water to move in a circular motion. Water molecules involved in wave motion only rotate in place and have little translational motion in the direction of wave propagation, but have a huge amount of energy propagated along the waves.

Similar to water molecules â€” WAV3 join to the highly volatile Cryptocurrency market, it is not affected by a special deflation mechanism, but is highly yield.

## Deflation

* Each Transfer/Sell transaction on Uniswap will be charged 6% as transaction fee (of which 90% will be sent directly to WStake as rewards, ðŸ”¥10% will be burned immediately, the total supply will go down continuously until reaching 30,000 WAV3)

* Buy transactions on Uniswap will be charged no fee

This will nurture the Bulls and leave the Bears malnourished.

## Token Distribution

* Total Supply: 100,000 WAV3

*There is absolutely no way to generate a new WAV3 token. This means that circulating supply can only go down because the burn function is incorporated in Deflation.*

* Pre-sale: 45,000 WAV3
* Add Uniswap Pool: 25,000 WAV3
* Saving: 10,000 WAV3
* Marketing/Listing CEX: 20,000 WAV3 (locked 4 years, of which 5,000 will be unlocked after 2 weeks)
